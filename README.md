I have done data analysis on T20 worldcup .This was my first project and it was intresting to deep dive into analysis
Initial steps from collecting data till making dashboard were knolwdgeable and i really learned from this project.
I collected data of bowlers,batsmen,all players from 'ESPN Cricket' website and used pyhton for exploratory dataa analysis.
Used Powerbi to create dasboards and creted different pages for different positions of players,All these will be helpful for IPL Franchises for selecting players for their teams
